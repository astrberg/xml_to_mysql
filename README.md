# XML to MySQL
A Rust tool to download a XML file from [Datex II](https://datex2.eu/), parse the data and insert it to a MySQL database.

## Notice
This tool was made for my own sake of practice and interest, time is scarce and maybe I will spend some more time polishing this tool but don't expect much.

## Installation

## Usage

```rust
extern crate ...
