# XML to MySQL
A Rust tool to download a XML file from [Datex II](https://datex2.eu/), parse the data and insert it to a MySQL database.

## Notice
This tool was made for my own sake of practice and interest, time is scarce and maybe I will spend some more time polishing this tool but don't expect much.

## Installation

Use [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install XML to MySQL.
